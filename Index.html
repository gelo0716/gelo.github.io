                <h3 class="post-title">THE BEST ADVICE EVER TO A TEENAGE DAUGHTER WHO NEEDS TO MAKE MONEY</h3>
                <div class="post-content">


                    <p> She said “No” to me and slammed the door. She was on my paper route. </p>

                    <p> I asked out every girl on my paper route. All three of them. I liked having a captive audience.
                        I’d hand them the paper and say, “Want to go to a movie?” </p>

                    <p> They all said “No.”</p>

                    <p>Well, one girl said, “Yes” but then the next day her brother told me she really meant “No.”</p>

                    <p> I made about $2 an hour on my paper route. It took me about four hours a day and then another
                        five
                        or six hours on the weekends collecting money.</p>

                    <p> One time, delivering papers, a guy drove by and yelled, “one day you’re going to rule the
                        world!”</p>

                    <p> I guess because delivering papers somehow showed work ethic. I worked hard but hated it. I had
                        no
                        life but delivering papers.</p>

                    <p> So I will tell you another story. Don’t tell anyone please. It’s our secret. </p>

                    <p> The local video store once gave me pamphlets to put at every house on my route. He gave me a $20
                        bill. I took it. </p>

                    <p> Within 15 minutes, I threw all the pamphlets in the sewer and never went back to that store.</p>

                    <strong> All of this is to say:</strong>

                    <p> My daughter is considering taking an $8 an hour job.</p>

                    <p> I said to her, instead of that: why don’t you go to Lynda.com or CodeAcademy.com and learn basic
                        WordPress skills. You can make blogs for stores.</p>

                    <p> It would take you ONE DAY to learn the basics.</p>

                    <p> Then go from door to door to every store in town.</p>

                    <p> Say for $1000, plus $50 / month maintenance, you’ll make their blog or basic website for them
                        and
                        help them upkeep it. If they require a “shopping cart” then charge them $2500.</p>

                    <p> She frowned a little and said, “They will say No. They don’t need it.”</p>

                    <p> She doesn’t want anyone to say No to her. I can relate to that. <a
                            href="https://jamesaltucher.com/blog/what-to-do-when-you-are-rejected/">I don’t like it when
                            people say
                            No
                            to me either.</a> </p>

                    <p> I said, “OK, we have about 40 stores on this street. Let’s say only 2 say yes. That’s $2000. It
                        will
                        take you ten hours to do the work.</p>

                    <p><strong> That’s $200 an hour instead of $8 an hour.</strong></p>

                    <p> And then the $100 a month you make in maintenance will take you about two hours a month.</p>

                    <p> Here’s another idea, I said. To be on Wikipedia you need about 10 media references.</p>

                    <p> We were in a restaurant. I pointed at the wall. “How many reviews does this restaurant have.”
                    </p>

                    <p>She was digging in. “I don’t know.” She looked away.</p>

                    <p> “More than ten,” I said. “So you can make a Wikipedia page for them. Charge $200. Maintain it
                        for
                        $10 a month.”</p>

                    <p> Or maybe every store needs a Facebook page. 1 in 7 Americans are on Facebook RIGHT NOW THIS
                        SECOND. </p>

                    <p> Restaurants can use their Page to get local customers to “Like” them in exchange for coupons and
                        future messages. </p>

                    <p><strong> Again: $500 for setup and $20 per store per month to maintain.</strong></p>

                    <p> She didn’t want to do it. It’s not a skills issue. <a
                            href="https://jamesaltucher.com/blog/the-skills-we-all-need-but-college-doesnt-teach/">ANYONE
                            can get the skills by studying one or
                            two
                            online courses for about a day or two.</a> </p>

                    <p> She does have skills at drawing logos, editing short videos, and some basic design skills she
                        can
                        improve with a course or two. </p>

                    <p> On fiverr or freelancer.com she can do an infographic for $20-50 and it would take her thirty
                        minutes.</p>

                    <strong> Why work for a boss?</strong>

                    <p> Here’s my guess. She wants to work at a hang out place. So she can work while seeing her
                        friends.</p>

                    <p> Ok, I get that. I would love to work at the same time that I hang out with my friends.</p>

                    <p> But if she started doing what I suggest here’s what she would learn:</p>

                    <span style="color:blue; font-weight: bold;"> A) SHE WOULD CREATE SOMETHING OUT OF NOTHING.</span>
                    <br>
                    <p> Most jobs don’t let you create something out of nothing.</p>

                    <p> You just move some shit over to some other shit and get paid shit.</p>

                    <p> The best things in the world are when you create something out of nothing. Like: I created her
                        (in
                        part) out of nothing.</p>

                    <p> I admit I had help with that.</p>



                    <p style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;"> B) BASIC COMPUTER SKILLS.</p>
                    <p> Seriously: if you think you don’t have computer skills, take three online courses.</p>

                    <p> Now you are in the top 1% of the world in computer skills and can charge for those skills.</p>

                                    </em>. But
                                    Im on my journey there, if only my parents taught me the value of saving and
                                    investing early on?
                                    I might hit the 7 figures in my late 20s. But they didn't and to make things clear?
                                    <em>I don't
                                        blame them. I can blame myself but not them.</em>

                                <p>Information at their time was so darn hard and if any drip of ideas about investing
                                    are
                                    available? Its on the hand of the 1%. Who's that 1%? Those few people that have the
                                    cash to
                                    invest and profit from a 10-20% return annualy. Those people that can enter the

                                    its early years in the Philippines when Jollibee, SM, Ayala Corp were still infant.
                                    Those people
                                    who are already rich and still kicking the scene coz they can afford to do so and

                                    the saying "Yung mga mayayaman na lalo pang yumayaman" sila yun! ...</p>

                                <p>As I enter my late 20's I started educating myself and after reading tons of

                                    finance and self optimization articles? <strong> I came up with the things I wish my

                                        told about money when I was young: </strong></p>
                                <br>

                                <p><strong>1. I wish they given me the control over my money.</strong>
                                    <br>
                                    <br> I noticed that in my 20s? I am a compulsive buyer and a consistent "penge ng
                                    pera mama kase
                                    ubos
                                    na sahod ko advocate". I wish they could have trusted me money when I was young.
                                    Yung tipong
                                    they will allocate a budget for me tapos ako bahala in a week sa baon ko. Ill be
                                    responsible if
                                    maubos ko yun at di na nila ko bibigyan kapag naubos ko yung pondo ko. I have the
                                    power over my
                                    money but they will teach me how to budget it, allocate it for simple goals and life
                                    savings.
                                </p>

                                <p> May classmate ako nung HS, 1 week na baon nasakanya na, tapos sobrang natitipid na
                                    nya yun
                                    hanngang sa next week di na nya gagalawin pera nya ihuhulog na nya sa alkansya.
                                    Syempre
                                    nawiwirduhan ako sakanya non pero I know wherever she is now? She carried that
                                    principle of
                                    being responsible over her money through out her life.</p>

                                <p>The result will probably be that I'll spend too much on frivolous stuff. At first.
                                    But when I
                                    want other things, I have to learn to save for them, and cut back on other areas.
                                    Eventually,
                                    I'll learn how to make decisions, through trial and error. It could take awhile, but
                                    it’s better
                                    I learn ng maaga kesa tumanda na ko ng walang pinagkatandaan.</p>

                                <p><strong> 2.I wish they taught me that money can make its own babies</strong></p>

                                <p> It can really multiplies itself. Trust me. It can create its own replica! No, not
                                    the photo copy
                                    kind of thing pero in a form of interests. I wish I have that idea of saving back
                                    when I was a
                                    child yung tipong ilalagay ko talga sa bank account ko tapos makikita ko na tutubo
                                    kahit maliit,
                                    atleast thats the basic foundation being taught there. I never heard them talked
                                    about
                                    investments either and that's sad.
                                </p>

                                <p><strong> 3.Work Smart not Work Hard</strong></p>


                                <p> You can definitely get some cash from working hard no doubt, but in order for you to
                                    create
                                    wealth and be worry free as days goes by? You need to work smarter than anyone else.
                                    Its not in
                                    the context na manlalamang ka na ng kapwa mo. What I am saying is be more smarter on
                                    getting
                                    things done by simply allocating your time and efforts more efficiently. In my case
                                    I work a
                                    full time job and still have some side hustles that creates a new stream of income
                                    for me every
                                    month. If you can budget your cash flow? You must also budget your time to be more
                                    productive
                                    and to look for opportunities that will make you grow and in the end? Will add to
                                    your savings
                                    account.</p>


                                <p>I cant imagine myself na umaasa lang sa paychecks ko every 15 days. But this is just
                                    me ok? 3
                                    years ago? Di din ganto mindset ko, but I learned and so I wish I have this
                                    framework nung totoy
                                    pa lang ako.


                                <p> <strong> 4.Wish they taught me about saving for a goal</strong></p>

                                <p>I don't have much when I was a kid, baon ko is around 5 pesos when I was on early
                                    years of
                                    elementary and 20 or 30 pesos when I was on grade 4 to 6, 50 pesos when I was on
                                    High School and
                                    80 pesos on my College years. I dont have that capacity (Well, I can If I want it or
                                    have the
                                    audacity to do so) to save for anything coz in my mind? Ma and Pa will provide. The
                                    reason why I
                                    dont have a cellphone till I worked on a Part- time job at Jollibee kase kala ko
                                    bibilhan nila
                                    ko, well it ends up na di pala. <em>Hahahaha!</em></p>

                                <p>My parents and I do some window shopping on malls dati, kase nung bata pa ko we tend
                                    to go out
                                    and watch movies kapag off ng mother ko. Minsan nabibilhan ako ng laruan minsan
                                    hindi..:) Pero
                                    di nila nabanggit na mag ipon ako para mabili ko yung bagay na gusto ko. Did they
                                    told me that?
                                    Or didn't they? If they did? Its my bad then for not remembering.

                                <p> <strong> 5.Surround yourself with smarter and pro-active people</strong></p>

                                <p>I wish I had this idea when I was just literally figuring things out in my life. I
                                    joined
                                    several groups on my High School and College days like Performing Arts, Science
                                    Clubs, Student
                                    Government Clubs etc. but I don't intend to be educated there. I JUST WANT THE FAME.
                                    <em>(One
                                        hard
                                        slap for my moronic young dumb and broke self)</em>. So i don't attend meetings
                                    that much
                                    and I don't
                                    associate myself with smarter people better than I am. I have the opportunity in
                                    plain sight
                                    pero di ko pinansin.

                                <p>Later in life I fixed my self and learned that surrounding yourself with good people
                                    is
                                    essential if you want to get ahead in any area, because successful people lift you
                                    up to their
                                    level. They inspire and motivate, and lead by example. Better yet, they encourage
                                    you to explore
                                    ideas and situations that you may not normally pursue on your own. </p>

                                    <span><strong>Delayed Gratification</strong></span>

                                    <p> Yeah, my family is not rich but that made me disciplined enough not to be a
                                        lavish spender
                                        in
                                        tagalog KURIPOT hahahha! But that's one of the lessons I really loved about my
                                        parents, Ma
                                        will
                                        make me wait and she promises to buy me a toy only If I wait for a week or two.
                                        With that
                                        simple
                                        move? She made me realize that there are far more enjoyable toys that I can play
                                        with. Tapos
                                        minsan kapag pinaalala na ni Ma yung laruan? Madalas eh ayoko na. I dont know if
                                        that was a
                                        lesson or talagang tactics nya yun para makatipid. Nevertheless it taught me
                                        about self
                                        control
                                        and that all huge return takes time. Want to see a proof of this thing on kids?

                                <p><em> We are not born with self-control. Ask any parent. It’s something we need to
                                        learn. As per
                                        this
                                        experiment by Stanford University, the kids were tracked over a 14 year period
                                        with
                                        interesting
                                        results. The kids with less will power (‘’grabbers’’) suffered from low esteem
                                        and were more
                                        prone to envy and frustration. The kids who waited before taking the sweet
                                        (those with more
                                        self-control) were more socially competent, self-assertive, trustworthy,
                                        dependable and
                                        academically successful. I’m not preaching here, this is what the research tells
                                        us. I think
                                        you
                                        will agree self-control is important. This brings me to the concept of delayed
                                        gratification.

                                <p>Who would have shy away from a return on investment? That will be a dumb move, but
                                    people are
                                    so
                                    focused on instant gratification that they want their cash to multiply x2 agad agad
                                    of what
                                    they
                                    invest. Di po ganun ang reality ang totoo is IT TAKES TIME. Kaya nga maraming
                                    nalululong sa
                                    pagsusugal at pagtaya ng lotto coz they think that its the only way para makaahon
                                    sila sa
                                    kahirapan. Same reason why we fall to scams that tells us na madali lang kumita at
                                    saglit
                                    lang
                                    dodoble kagad yung capital mo.</p>

                                <p> I am not saying that I didn't fall for these kind of things pero now that I have my
                                    senses
                                    back?
                                    I can say that what my parents gave me is something to be treasured. Di man nila ko
                                    naturuan
                                    about saving and investing? They give me a gift that is irreplaceable of any
                                    monetary value.
                                    Something that I can pass to my children when time comes.</p>
